# BMI Calculator

A web application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI).

## Project Description

This project is a BMI calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator takes user input for height and weight and calculates the BMI based on the input. The BMI result is then displayed on the web page using DOM manipulation.

## Installation

To use the BMI calculator, simply clone the repository or download the project files. You can then open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the calculator.

## Usage

1. Open the BMI calculator web page (`index.html`) in your preferred web browser.
2. Input your height in centimeters (cm) in the provided input field.
3. Input your weight in kilograms (kg) in the provided input field.
4. Click the "Calculate BMI" button.
5. The calculated BMI value and the corresponding category will be displayed on the web page.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the BMI calculator web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles and layout for the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the BMI calculation and DOM manipulation.

## Development Process

The development of this project involved the following steps:

1. Designed the user interface (UI) using HTML and CSS, creating the necessary input fields and a button for BMI calculation.
2. Implemented the logic for calculating the BMI using vanilla JavaScript.
3. Used DOM manipulation techniques to display the calculated BMI and corresponding category on the web page.
